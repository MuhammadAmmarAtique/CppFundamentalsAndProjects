# C++ Learning and Projects Repository

Welcome to my C++ repository! This repository is designed to track my progress in learning C++ and contains well-organized directories for basic concepts, object-oriented programming (OOP), and simple projects that implement these concepts.

## Repository Structure

### 1. Learning C++

This folder contains files covering the fundamentals of C++, including:

- **Variables & Constants:** Basic variable declarations and constant usage.
- **Data Types:** Different types like `int`, `float`, `char`, etc.
- **User Input:** Methods to take input from users.
- **Operators:**
  - Arithmetic operators (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`).
  - Logical operators (`&&`, `||`, `!`).
  - Assignment operators (`=`, `+=`, `-=`) etc
- **Conditional Statements:** `if`, `else if`, `else` statements for decision-making.
- **Iterative Statements & Loops:**
  - `for`, `while`, and `do-while` loops.
- **Functions:** Function creation, usage, and types.
- **Arrays:** Storing and manipulating data using arrays.

### 2. OOP (Object-Oriented Programming)

This folder covers the four pillars of OOP in C++:

- **Classes & Objects:** How to define and use a class in C++ to encapsulate data and behavior. 
- **Constructors:** Explanation of constructor usage for initializing objects.
- **Encapsulation:** Learned about encapsulation in C++ by using private data members and public getter and setter methods to control access to an object's attributes.
- **Abstraction:** Hiding complex implementation details.
- **Inheritance:** Code reuse through class inheritance.
- **Polymorphism:** Learned how Polymorphism is used through method overriding, where the work() method in the Employee class is overridden by the Developer and Doctor classes to provide class-specific behavior.

### 3. Simple C++ Projects

This folder contains small projects that apply the concepts learned:

- **Calculator Using If-Else:** A simple calculator that performs basic operations using if-else statements.
- **Calculator Using Switch:** A calculator that performs basic operations using a switch-case structure.
- **Temperature Converter (If-Else):** A tool that converts temperatures between Celsius and Fahrenheit using if-else.
- **Temperature Converter (Switch):** A similar temperature converter using switch-case.
- **Simple Bank System:** A basic bank system implemented using structures and if-else statements.
